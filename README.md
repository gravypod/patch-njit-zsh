# Patch ZSH Features for NJIT Kong

I use ZSH. I don't know why anyone wouldn't. Unfortunately some people 
make bad decitions (like forcing users to use bash). This is a port of 
NJIT's AFS bash RC that works under ZSH.

# How to use zsh?

1. Install Oh-My-ZSH
2. echo '. ~/.patch-afs-features-zsh' > ~/.zshrc
3. When you run into Wolosh or Perel around campus beg them to change your default shell.
